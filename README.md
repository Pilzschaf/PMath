## Pilzschaf Math Library
This is a math library for 3D games written in C++.
This repository is developed next to my german "Mathematik f√ºr Spieleentwickler" tutorial series
You can find the code for the different parts in the corresponding branches.
The master branch is always on the newest version (which might be newer than the last tutorial).
