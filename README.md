## Pilzschaf Math Library
This is an header-only math library for 3D games written in C++.
See the main.cpp file for example usage.
This repository is developed next to my german "Mathematik f√ºr Spieleentwickler" tutorial series
You can find the code for the different parts in the corresponding branches.
The master branch is always on the newest version (which might be newer than the last tutorial).
